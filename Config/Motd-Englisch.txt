This is a very early alpha in which the Project is located. I`m not responsible for any Problems associated with the execution of the Program. 
So far, the most functions are implemented. This is a hobby project! Everything can cause mistakes and create problems! Use at your own risk!
Everything is based on PowerShell. The performance will improve. Bugs, suggestions for improvement and Feedback will be read gladly.
There are parts of the program cut off or postponed, then I ask you to write me an email, including the OS version, PowerShell and .Net framework version and screen size and resolution.
For this yo can simply Write me a Mail to HyperV-Manager@MinersWin.de .
